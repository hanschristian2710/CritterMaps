**Critter Eater** is a class/inheritance implementation which simulate a graphical 2D with animals in it that move around and fight each other animal. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository above
2. Open the project's files using any IDE (Eclipse preferrably)
3. Import external library (uwcse.jar)
4. Run the module program

## Video overview

Here's an overview of the project:

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/NjvQagI.gif' title='Critter' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />

The number on the right is showing, how many object/animals left on the map.

The object and animal is shown in a single word: 

1. L = Lion 
2. T = Tiger
3. W = Wolf
4. B = Bear
5. S = Stone

For the number of each object and animals, it can be changed in the CritterMain.java 
```
model.add(25, Stone.class);
model.add(25, Bear.class);
model.add(25, Lion.class);
model.add(25, Tiger.class);
model.add(25, Wolf.class);
```
In this case, each object and animals have 25 units in the map.
